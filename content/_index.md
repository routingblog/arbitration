Quick Summary (from court staff summary):
> An ADEA[^2] claim can be subjected to compulsory arbitration

Pull Quote from Dissent[^3]:
> When the FAA was passed in 1925, I doubt that any legislator who voted for it expected it to apply to statutory claims, to form contracts between parties of unequal bargaining power, or to the arbitration of disputes arising out of the em- ployment relationship. In recent years, however, the Court "has effectively rewritten the statute," and abandoned its earlier view that statutory claims were not appropriate subjects for arbitration.

Issue: Whether a participant in a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act who asserts statutory claims under that statute can be compelled, pursuant to a binding arbitration provision, to submit his claims to individual arbitration.

## 17-988 Lamps Plus, Inc. V. Varela (04/24/2019). (2019).

Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), an arbitration agreement that is ambiguous as to the availability of class arbitration does not manifest sufficient consent by the parties to submit to class arbitration. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that the arbitration agreement between Varela and his employer, Lamps Plus, which contained only general language commonly used in arbitration agreements, did not provide the necessary contractual basis for compelling class arbitration.

## 22-1098 - Harrison v. Envision Management Holding, Inc. Board, et al. [10975747]
Related: Harrison v. Envision Holding Management Inc. Board of Directors, et al., No. 22-1098 (United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit).

Pull Quote:
> by prohibiting a claimant such as Harrison from obtaining any form of relief that would benefit anyone other than himself, prevents the effective vindication of the statutory remedies outlined in § 1132(a)(2). In other words, the effect of Section 21 of the Plan, if enforced, would be that participant/claimants such as Harrison would be left without any guarantee that a suit seeking the statutory remedies set forth in § 1132(a)(2) would ever be filed by the DOL (and, in turn, that those statutory remedies would ever be available).

- Decision: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-328_m6ho.pdf
- Author: Elena Kagan (unanimous)

Core Claim (pull quote):

> This Court granted certiorari to resolve the split over whether federal courts may adopt an arbitration-specific waiver rule demanding a showing of prejudice.

# Non Supreme Court Federal Cases

## Zenia Chavarria v. Ralphs Grocery Company, 733 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2013)

Pull Quote (from court staff summary):

> The policy was procedurally unconscionable because it was a condition of applying for employment and was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis. In addition, its terms were not provided to the plaintiff until three weeks after she had agreed to be bound by it.
> Specifically, the policy’s arbitrator selection process would always produce an arbitrator proposed by the defendant in employee-initiated arbitration proceedings; the policy precluded institutional arbitration administrators, which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator; and the policy’s arbitrator-fee-apportionment provision would have the effect of pricing employees out of the dispute resolution process

## Richards v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 11-17530, 2013 WL 4437601 (9th Cir. Aug. 21, 2013).

Status: Effectively Reversed by [Morgan]({{< relref "/#morgan-v-sundance" >}}) [^1]
