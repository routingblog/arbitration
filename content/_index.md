# Scope


Mandatory arbitration is a controversial practice in which a business requires employees or consumers to agree to arbitrate legal disputes with the business rather than going to court. Although seemingly voluntary in that the employee or consumer can choose whether or not to sign the arbitration agreement, in practice signing the agreement is required if the individual wants to get the job or to obtain the cellphone, credit card, or other consumer product the business is selling.  Mandatory arbitration agreements are legally enforceable and effectively bar employees or consumers from going to court, instead diverting legal claims into an arbitration procedure that is established by the agreement drafted by the company and required as a condition of employment or of doing business with it.

The goal of this website is discuss _forced arbitration_ and _class action waivers_ in _consumer_ and _employment_ disputes. Other aspects of arbitration are discussed mostly in the context of how they affect these two pieces of the puzzle.

Arbitration is often as a cheaper, faster, and more efficient mechanism to resolve disputes. In reality, arbitration serves to eliminate meaningful recourse for violations of contract or of the law.
