# Supreme Court Decisions

## Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., 293 U.S. 449 (1935)

One Line Summary: power to grant a stay is not conditioned on power to compel arbitration. Existence of arbitration agreement is an equitable defense.

- [Court Opinion (Court Listener)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/102354/shanferoke-coal-supply-corp-v-westchester-service-corp)
- Majority Author:   Louis Dembitz Brandeis (9-0 unanimous)

{{< details "Pull quote (From Majority)" >}}
We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that the power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with § 4 of the Act.

## Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427 (1953) {id="wilko-v-swan"}

{{< details "Pull Quote (from majority):" >}}
Two policies, not easily reconcilable, are involved in this case. Congress has afforded participants in transactions subject to its legislative power an opportunity generally to secure prompt, economical and adequate solution of controversies through arbitration if the parties are willing to accept less certainty of legally correct adjustment. On the other hand, it has enacted the Securities Act to protect the rights of investors and has forbidden a waiver of any of those rights. Recognizing the advantages that prior agreements for arbitration may provide for the solution of commercial controversies, we decide that the intention of Congress concerning the sale of securities is better carried out by holding invalid such an agreement for arbitration of issues arising under the Act.

> a federal court may not consider a claim of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally, but "may consider only the issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate." Pp. 388 U. S. 402-404.

> Since the claim of fraud here relates to inducement of the consulting agreement generally, rather than in the arbitration clause, and there is no evidence that the parties intended to withhold this issue from arbitration, there is no basis for granting a stay under § 3. Pp. 388 U. S. 406-407.
{{< /details >}}

### Analysis

> Recognizing as "broad" a clause requiring arbitration of"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to" the agreement
> Holding that if the making of the arbitration agreement is an issue "the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it"

> Holding that contractual language "[a]ny controversy or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach thereof" is "easily broad enough to encompass" claim for fraud in inducement of contract

> The Prima Paint Court erred, however, in asserting that the FAA’s basis was “confined to” Congress’s interstate commerce and admiralty power. That assertion is flat out wrong: As we have seen, the legislative history shows that Congress placed primary reliance for enacting the FAA on its control over the procedures of the federal courts.

{{< details "Moses H Cone" >}}
...any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration...

...unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute...

Section 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary. The effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.

> When the FAA was passed in 1925, I doubt that any legislator who voted for it expected it to apply to statutory claims, to form contracts between parties of unequal bargaining power, or to the arbitration of disputes arising out of the employment relationship. In recent years, however, the Court "has effectively rewritten the statute," and abandoned its earlier view that statutory claims were not appropriate subjects for arbitration.

{{< details "Pull Quote (from syllabus):" >}}
Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not "any contract," but specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration," conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal meas- ure. Generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening § 2, see, e. g., Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281, but courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions

Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), an arbitration agreement that is ambiguous as to the availability of class arbitration does not manifest sufficient consent by the parties to submit to class arbitration. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that the arbitration agreement between Varela and his employer, Lamps Plus, which contained only general language commonly used in arbitration agreements, did not provide the necessary contractual basis for compelling class arbitration.

> Specifically, the policy’s arbitrator selection process would always produce an arbitrator proposed by the defendant in employee-initiated arbitration proceedings; the policy precluded institutional arbitration administrators, which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator; and the policy’s arbitrator-fee-apportionment provision would have the effect of pricing employees out of the dispute resolution process

    {{< details "Knapp - Taking Contracts Private - Conclusion" >}}
The mandatory arbitration clause is thus sui generis, unlike any
other boilerplate provision that a stronger party might impose in a
take-it-or-leave-it contract. Every other provision-even a choice-of-
law or forum selection clause-can at least be tested by some court of
law, where the conflicting claims of freedom of contract and freedom
from economic oppression can be publicly weighed and assessed.
Enforcement of the mandatory arbitration clause, however, means
that neither the arbitration clause nor any other portion of that
adhesion contract can be so tested. Left unchecked, mandatory
arbitration will effectively "solve" the adhesion contract problem, to
be sure, but in much the same way as the Austrians in the 1938
Anschluss solved their Nazi problem: by handing over the keys to the
city.

186. There have been a smattering of area-specific legislative prohibitions against mandatory arbitration. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 7 U.S.C.A. §26 (providing that an employee cannot waive his right to a judicial forum regarding a dispute that arises under the whistleblower protection section of the act); 10 U.S.C. § 987(e)(3), (f)(4) (voiding arbitration clauses in payday loan or consumer credit contracts, with the exception of residential mortgages and car loans, for members of the military or their families); 15 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2) (prohibiting automobile manufacturers from imposing pre-dispute arbitration clauses in their franchise agreements with dealers); Truth In Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1639c (no mortgage lender may include a pre-dispute arbitration clause in its loan agreements); Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(e) (contracts requiring pre-dispute arbitration of whistleblower claims under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act not enforceable); Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-118, §8116(a), 123 Stat. 3409, 3454 (prohibits federal contractors who receive funds under the Act for contracts in excess of $1,000,000 from requiring their employees or independent contractors to arbitrate “any claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment”). Numerous bills also seek broader overriding of the Supreme Court’s pro-arbitration jurisprudence. See, e.g., Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011, S. 987, 112th Cong. § 2929 (2011); Arbitration Fairness Act of 2009, H.R. 1020 § 4, 111th Cong, 155 Cong. Rec. H. 1517 (2009); Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007, S. 1782 § 4, 110th Cong, 153 Cong. Rec. S. 9144 (2007). The most recent version of this bill was introduced by Senators Al Franken (D-Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Representative Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) immediately after Concepcion was decided, and would prohibit class action bans in all consumer, employment, and civil-rights related contracts. See David Lazarus, Bill Aims to Restore Consumers’ Right to Sue, L.A. TIMES (Oct. 18, 2011), available at http://articles.latimes.com/2011/ oct/18/business/la-fi-lazarus-20111018. See also Consumer Mobile Fairness Act of 2011, S. 1652, 112th Cong. § 3 (2011). This bill, introduced by Senators Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Pa.), would void arbitration clauses in mobile phone contracts. While both the Arbitration Fairness Act and the Consumer Mobile Fairness Act were referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held hearings under the chairmanship of Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), neither bill cleared the committee. See Michelle L. Caton, Form Over Fairness: How the Supreme Court’s Misreading of the Federal Arbitration Act Has Left Consumers in Lurch, 21 GEO. MASON L. REV. 497, 527 (2014) (“Of the 139 bills introduced into Congress between 1995 and 2010 that sought to restrict or eliminate various uses of mandatory arbitration, only five were eventually passed into law.”).

189. See, e.g., Schnuerle v. Insight Commc’ns, Inc., 376 S.W.3d 561, 569, 573 (Ky. 2012) (“[U]pon application of Concepcion, we are now constrained to conclude that under contracts like the one now before us, which contain a class action waiver and also require disputes to be arbitrated under the FAA, the federal policy favoring arbitration preempts any state law or policy invalidating the class action waiver as unconscionable based solely upon the grounds that the dispute involves many de minimis claims which are, individually, unlikely to be litigated. . . . We, of course, yield as we must to the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of federal law.”); Willis v. Debt Care, USA, Inc., No. 3:11-cv430-ST, 2011 WL 7121456, at *7–8 (D. Or. Oct. 24, 2011) (“[T]he vast majority of numerous, smallvalue claims . . . for statutory violations will go unprosecuted unless they may be brought as a class due to the high costs associated with pursuing individual claims. . . . This court is sympathetic to the [plaintiffs’] argument. Regrettably, AT&T forecloses many consumer class actions which may provide the only recovery for wronged individuals.”); Porreca v. Rose Grp., 2013 WL 6498392, at *1, *15 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 11, 2013) (complaining that the decision to uphold the class action ban was “unappetizing” and “lamentable”); Dean v. Draughons Junior Coll., Inc., 917 F.Supp.2d 751, 765 (M.D. Tenn. 2013) (“While required by the FAA, this result strikes the court as manifestly unjust and, perhaps, deserving of legislative attention. . . . [I]n cases such as the one presented here, requiring impoverished individuals to arbitrate could effectively prevent them from exercising their rights as state citizens.”).
