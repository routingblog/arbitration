### Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co. (In re Ford Motor Warranty Cases)

Quote:

Pull Quote (from syllabus):

{{< details "Pull Quote (from syllabus):" >}}
> The policy was procedurally unconscionable because it was a condition of applying for employment and was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis. In addition, its terms were not provided to the plaintiff until three weeks after she had agreed to be bound by it.
> Specifically, the policy’s arbitrator selection process would always produce an arbitrator proposed by the defendant in employee-initiated arbitration proceedings; the policy precluded institutional arbitration administrators, which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator; and the policy’s arbitrator-fee-apportionment provision would have the effect of pricing employees out of the dispute resolution process

### Harrison v. Envision Holding Management Inc. Board of Directors, et al., No. 22-1098 (United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit). (2023)

Pull Quote:
> by prohibiting a claimant such as Harrison from obtaining any form of relief that would benefit anyone other than himself, prevents the effective vindication of the statutory remedies outlined in § 1132(a)(2). In other words, the effect of Section 21 of the Plan, if enforced, would be that participant/claimants such as Harrison would be left without any guarantee that a suit seeking the statutory remedies set forth in § 1132(a)(2) would ever be filed by the DOL (and, in turn, that those statutory remedies would ever be available).

- [Statement Of Interest Of The United States Of America](https://www.justice.gov/d9/cases/attachments/2023/03/07/statement_of_interest_citibank-final.pdf)
    > Section 4042(a)(3) allows plaintiffs in this case to participate in an SCRA class action in federal court notwithstanding their previous agreement to individual arbitration, regardless of when the SCRA violations are alleged to have occurred. The United States respectfully urges the Court to deny Defendant Citibank, N.A.’s motion to compel arbitration of the SCRA claims.
