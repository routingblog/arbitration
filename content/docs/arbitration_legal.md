# Supreme Court Decisions

## Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., 293 U.S. 449 (1935)

One Line Summary: power to grant a stay is not conditioned on power to compel arbitration. Existence of arbitration agreement is an equitable defense.

- [Court Opinion (Court Listener)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/102354/shanferoke-coal-supply-corp-v-westchester-service-corp)
- Majority Author:   Louis Dembitz Brandeis (9-0 unanimous)

{{< details "Pull quote (From Majority)" >}}
We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that the power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with § 4 of the Act.

## Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427 (1953) {id="wilko-v-swan"}

One Line Summary: The Securities Act overrides the Federal Arbitration Act (the judicial forum is a “a substantial right” and thus non-waivable).

- Status: **Reversed by [Rodriguez]({{< relref "/#Quijas-v-american-express" >}})**

{{< details "Pull Quote (from majority):" >}}
Two policies, not easily reconcilable, are involved in this case. Congress has afforded participants in transactions subject to its legislative power an opportunity generally to secure prompt, economical and adequate solution of controversies through arbitration if the parties are willing to accept less certainty of legally correct adjustment. On the other hand, it has enacted the Securities Act to protect the rights of investors and has forbidden a waiver of any of those rights. Recognizing the advantages that prior agreements for arbitration may provide for the solution of commercial controversies, we decide that the intention of Congress concerning the sale of securities is better carried out by holding invalid such an agreement for arbitration of issues arising under the Act.

> a federal court may not consider a claim of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally, but "may consider only the issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate." Pp. 388 U. S. 402-404.

> Since the claim of fraud here relates to inducement of the consulting agreement generally, rather than in the arbitration clause, and there is no evidence that the parties intended to withhold this issue from arbitration, there is no basis for granting a stay under § 3. Pp. 388 U. S. 406-407.
{{< /details >}}

### Analysis

> Recognizing as "broad" a clause requiring arbitration of"[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to" the agreement
> Holding that if the making of the arbitration agreement is an issue "the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it"

> Holding that contractual language "[a]ny controversy or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or breach thereof" is "easily broad enough to encompass" claim for fraud in inducement of contract

> The Prima Paint Court erred, however, in asserting that the FAA’s basis was “confined to” Congress’s interstate commerce and admiralty power. That assertion is flat out wrong: As we have seen, the legislative history shows that Congress placed primary reliance for enacting the FAA on its control over the procedures of the federal courts.

...any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration...

...unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute...

Section 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary. The effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.

## Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. 500 U.S. 20 (1991)

One Line Summary: An ADEA claim can be subjected to compulsory arbitration.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmer_v._Interstate/Johnson_Lane_Corp.)
- [LoC Opinion](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep500/usrep500020/usrep500020.pdf) (unread)
- Majority Author: Byron White
- Dissents: John Paul Stevens

Mr. Gilmer, the Court held, would not be harmed by the agreed-upon switch to arbitration because his arbitrator would be bound to follow substantive federal age-discrimination law, and the procedures unilaterally set up by the employer to govern the arbitration proceedings were not unfair. There was no inequality of bargaining power, in part because Mr. Gilmer was an "experienced businessman". [^feedagger]

Pull Quote from Dissent (pg 42):
> When the FAA was passed in 1925, I doubt that any legislator who voted for it expected it to apply to statutory claims, to form contracts between parties of unequal bargaining power, or to the arbitration of disputes arising out of the employment relationship. In recent years, however, the Court "has effectively rewritten the statute," and abandoned its earlier view that statutory claims were not appropriate subjects for arbitration.

{{< details "Pull Quote (from syllabus):" >}}
Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not "any contract," but specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration," conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal meas- ure. Generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening § 2, see, e. g., Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281, but courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions

Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), an arbitration agreement that is ambiguous as to the availability of class arbitration does not manifest sufficient consent by the parties to submit to class arbitration. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that the arbitration agreement between Varela and his employer, Lamps Plus, which contained only general language commonly used in arbitration agreements, did not provide the necessary contractual basis for compelling class arbitration.

> The policy was procedurally unconscionable because it was a condition of applying for employment and was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis. In addition, its terms were not provided to the plaintiff until three weeks after she had agreed to be bound by it.
> Specifically, the policy’s arbitrator selection process would always produce an arbitrator proposed by the defendant in employee-initiated arbitration proceedings; the policy precluded institutional arbitration administrators, which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator; and the policy’s arbitrator-fee-apportionment provision would have the effect of pricing employees out of the dispute resolution process

Pull Quote:
> by prohibiting a claimant such as Harrison from obtaining any form of relief that would benefit anyone other than himself, prevents the effective vindication of the statutory remedies outlined in § 1132(a)(2). In other words, the effect of Section 21 of the Plan, if enforced, would be that participant/claimants such as Harrison would be left without any guarantee that a suit seeking the statutory remedies set forth in § 1132(a)(2) would ever be filed by the DOL (and, in turn, that those statutory remedies would ever be available).
