## Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681 (1996)

One Line Summary: The FAA must also inquire whether it singles out arbitration or treats arbitration provisions with ‘suspect status’

- Supreme Court Database Record: [1995-055-01](http://scdb.wustl.edu/analysisCaseDetail.php?cid=1995-055-01)

{{< details "Pull Quote (from syllabus):" >}}
Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not "any contract," but specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration," conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal meas- ure. Generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening § 2, see, e. g., Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281, but courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions
{{< /details >}}

The Montana Supreme Court had two justices who refused to sign on to the order remanding the case from the Supreme Court of the United States to the state trial court. [^showdown1]

## 17-988 Lamps Plus, Inc. V. Varela (2019).

Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), an arbitration agreement that is ambiguous as to the availability of class arbitration does not manifest sufficient consent by the parties to submit to class arbitration. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that the arbitration agreement between Varela and his employer, Lamps Plus, which contained only general language commonly used in arbitration agreements, did not provide the necessary contractual basis for compelling class arbitration.

Pull Quote (from syllabus):

{{< details "Pull Quote (from syllabus):" >}}
> The policy was procedurally unconscionable because it was a condition of applying for employment and was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis. In addition, its terms were not provided to the plaintiff until three weeks after she had agreed to be bound by it.
> Specifically, the policy’s arbitrator selection process would always produce an arbitrator proposed by the defendant in employee-initiated arbitration proceedings; the policy precluded institutional arbitration administrators, which have established rules and procedures to select a neutral arbitrator; and the policy’s arbitrator-fee-apportionment provision would have the effect of pricing employees out of the dispute resolution process

Pull Quote:
> by prohibiting a claimant such as Harrison from obtaining any form of relief that would benefit anyone other than himself, prevents the effective vindication of the statutory remedies outlined in § 1132(a)(2). In other words, the effect of Section 21 of the Plan, if enforced, would be that participant/claimants such as Harrison would be left without any guarantee that a suit seeking the statutory remedies set forth in § 1132(a)(2) would ever be filed by the DOL (and, in turn, that those statutory remedies would ever be available).
