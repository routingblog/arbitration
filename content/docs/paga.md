# Introduction

California has a [unique law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&division=2.&title=&part=13.&chapter=&article=) which allows for employees to sue on behalf of the state. PAGA is crucial to enforce labor laws

# California Fair Pay and Employer Accountability Act of 2024 (CFPEAA).
