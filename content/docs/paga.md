# Introduction

California has a [unique law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&division=2.&title=&part=13.&chapter=&article=) which allows for employees to sue on behalf of the state. PAGA is crucial to enforce labor laws
where workers have signed arbitration clauses.

This law directly interrelates with arbitration agreements. [^shrinkingtoolbox]

# Court Cases

# Estrada v. Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc.

One Line Summary: the Court of Appeal properly concluded that a trial court “cannot dismiss a PAGA claim based on manageability.”

# California Fair Pay and Employer Accountability Act of 2024 (CFPEAA).

The employment bar is working on destroying one of the few tools employees for enforcing their rights. Despite what its name says, this act will certainly **hurt** employees and reduce employer accountability.
