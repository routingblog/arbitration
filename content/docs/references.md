In conclusion, the message of this article is: Watch this space. Members of the US arbitration ecosystem, whether they be willing members such as businesses or unwilling members such as employees and consumers, have very much been on a wild ride in the last few decades and the recent decisions, new legislation, and changing behavior by all involved means that this is only going to continue in the future.

    {{< details "Giles - Arbitration's Unraveling">}}
The 21st century has been a bleak one for proponents of collective litigation. The hegemonic rise of class-banning arbitration provisions has thwarted workers and consumers across the legal landscape, as the FAA has grown into a super-statute, frozen in a 1920’s conception of individual claiming.
But recent developments signal a thaw. Green shoots have appeared in Congress, which in 2022 amended the FAA for the first time in its history to exempt one important subset of litigation activity, possibly setting the stage for further rollbacks. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has explicitly rejected the assumption, widely held by lower courts, that the promotion of arbitration is a “favored policy” warranting the application of special rules of construction and procedure. The implications of this clarification are profound and should, by all rights, remove from the coverage of the FAA all claims by workers engaged in interstate commerce, among other effects.

As a consequence, parties must be cautious not only to thoroughly vet their draft arbitration agreements, but should also be as attentive as possible to legal developments that might render their arbitration agreements unenforceable in the future.

1. Jacobs, B. L. (n.d.). Often Wrong, Never in Doubt: How Anti-Arbitration Expectancy Bias May Limit Access to Justice. ACCESS TO JUSTICE, 62.

    This particular paper suggestions that arbitration may not be as bad as often stated. It deeply mistates the history of arbitration (for example it cites Keating for the basis of a 'national policy of arbitration' - something the Court invented from whole cloth. Nonetheless, it makes some interesting points and is worth reading.

    {{< details "Jacobs - Often Wrong - Conclusion Pull Quote" >}}
Regardless of the “objective” reality of the fairness or lack thereof of arbitration, negative perceptions of the process already are “transform[ing] the reality faced by policy-makers”76 and influencing the development of the law regarding arbitration. For example, the AAA no longer will accept certain new consumer debt collection arbitration filings,77 and, as part of a settlement with the Office of the Minnesota Attorney General, the National Arbitration Forum will stop accepting or participating in the processing or administration of any new consumer arbitrations.

    This is really about collective bargaining agreements and arbitration provisions therein and thus somewhat out of scope for this page.


    {{< details "Rubenstein - Assignment of Labor Arbitration" >}}
Stated somewhat differently, there should be a type of presumption, similar to that utilized under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, in favor of assignment of labor arbitration and the right to appeal from arbitration absent express language in the collective bargaining agreement prohibiting it.

    {{< details "Hamielec - Class Dismissed - Conclusion" >}}
Corporations view the gap in bargaining power between themselves and individuals as an opportunity to engage in an arbitrage of the law. With each edit, law firms strengthen arbitration provisions to survive courts’ skeptical analyses and handcuff claimants to an arbitrator’s largely unreviewable and peripherally biased decision.

> ...arbitration agreements were not used by U.S. businesses to require consumers, employees, franchisees, or other weaker parties to resolve disputes through private arbitration rather than in court. Instead, the use of arbitration was limited to business-to-business or management/union contexts. Indeed, to the limited extent that the possibility of such arbitration was considered by Congress in 1925, when it passed the FAA, those few who spoke on the issue made clear that they did not view such a use of arbitration as appropriate (pg 1636)`

    {{< details "Menkel-Meadow - Do the ‘Haves’ - Conclusion" >}}
In short, we think we know that the "'Haves' Come out Ahead" in ADR, as they do in litigation, but they may come out ahead in different ways or for different reasons. Therefore, as socio-legal scholars who have much to thank Marc Galanter for, it behooves the legal and social empiricists and reformers among us to collect the data we need so we can be more certain that the solutions we suggest will solve the problems that actually exist and not the ones we simply think exist. If the "'Haves' Come out Ahead" in both litigation and ADR, then where will we go next to achieve social justice in disputing?

    {{< details "Rosencrants - Heads I Win - Conclusion" >}}
While it stopped short of providing a uniform waiver analysis, the Court began to level the playing field between employees and employers bound by arbitration agreements by abolishing the prejudice requirement in waiver analysis. Employers who require job applicants to agree to mandatory arbitration begin the relationship with an imbalance of bargaining power. Employers’ use, as in Morgan, of strategic delays in invoking arbitration wrongly disadvantages employees and undermines the attributes of arbitration that Congress sought to invoke when it enacted the FAA. Removing the prejudice requirement was an important step toward safeguarding employee rights.

    {{< details "Schwartz - Jiggery-Pokery - Conclusion" >}}
Taken together, Justice Scalia’s major federal arbitration law opinions render unconscionability and public policy defenses to arbitration clauses virtually non-existent, while allowing corporate defendants to immunize themselves from class actions by the expedient of nesting a class action waiver in an arbitration clause. To achieve these results, Justice Scalia had to engage in a fair amount of jiggery-pokery on behalf of the long-lived five-Justice conservative bloc. One looking for principled conservative jurisprudence in Justice Scalia’s body of work should probably look elsewhere than his arbitration decisions. Justice Scalia abandoned his much-touted federalism principles early on, and eventually found in FAA cases an opportunity to transform arbitration agreements into “do-it- yourself tort reform.”83 While the phrase “jiggery-pokery” may well be long remembered, one can hope that Justice Scalia’s doctrinal jiggery-pokery in federal arbitration law will soon be overruled, gone and forgotten.

    {{< details "Schwartz - Correcting - Conclusion" >}}
Southland and its progeny are the result of bad statutory interpretation and even worse federalism. The historical evidence demonstrates that Congress never intended to preempt state law regulating arbitration agreements. To the contrary, the best interpretation of the FAA is that, by virtue of its savings clause, federal courts should normally be bound by state-law restrictions on arbitration enforcement. The evidence against Southland is so strong that it seems that no one defends it on the merits anymore: Southland lives on only because of the Court’s reluctance to overrule a statutory interpretation precedent, its desire to spread arbitration far and wide, or a combination of the two.

    {{< details "Gilles - Doctrine - Conclusion" >}}
It is hard to imagine that this game of high stakes musical chairs would have been a welcome outcome to the Reagan anti-lawsuit reformers. Much as the arbitration revolution does reduce lawsuits (the primary goal of the anti-lawsuit movement), it carries an externality that the reformers’ carefully crafted legislative agendas did not: namely, the cessation of common law development in entire areas of the law. This externality, all else being equal, is as likely to prejudice the interests of conservatives as it is liberals; it all depends on where you are when the music stops.

    {{< details "Colvin - case outcomes - conclusion" >}}
On the closely debated issue of repeat player effects in arbitration, this study finds strong evidence of a repeat employer advantage and, more problematically, evidence of an advantage to employers in repeat employer-arbitrator pairings. The existence of an employer advantage in repeat employer-arbitrator pairings may reflect arbitral bias in some of these cases.

    {{< details "Joshi - Keating Me - conclusion" >}}
EFASASHA is incomplete, but a good start. The FAIR Act provides a strong potion against compelled arbitration. Overturning Keating would return the power to determine contract common law to the states. However, some of those states may have an FAA equivalent, still forcing employees into arbitration against their employer. An Act that completely does away with forced arbitration, and which has pre-emptive effect, is the best remedy.

    This is the strongest "pro-arbitration" note so far. Even so, it merely states that there is "little emperical evidence" that arbitrators don't follow the law and has other fairly weak claims.

    {{< details "Drahozal - Lawless - Conclusion" >}}
    Clearly more research is needed to evaluate the extent to which arbitration actually is "lawless." The research to date, however, suggests that perhaps arbitration is less lawless than is sometimes feared.

    {{< details "Colvin - The growing use of mandatory arbitration - Conclusion" >}}
Mandatory employment arbitration has expanded to the point where it has now surpassed court litigation as the most common process through which the rights of American workers 12 are adjudicated and enforced. The rise of this problematic practice needs to be given much greater attention in employment policy discussions. If the Supreme Court does not reverse its trend of supporting mandatory arbitration and instead put the brakes on enforcement of class action waivers in its upcoming decision, it will be necessary for Congress to act in order to ensure that American workers have an effective means of enforcing the rights they have been promised.
