# About Me

Eitan Adler

I am not a lawyer. However, I have read *every* document linked from this site, including every footnote.

I also have a backlog of papers, documents, and studies to read on the topic. They are generally not linked until I've at least had a first pass read to understand what they are saying.

Comments via github are preferred but I can also be emailed at comment@arbitrationinformation.org
