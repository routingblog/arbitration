[CA SB-365 Civil procedure: arbitration](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB365) was signed on 10-OCT-23 which ammends CCP §1294.4 to add the text

> Notwithstanding Section 916, the perfecting of such an appeal shall not automatically stay any proceedings in the trial court during the pendency of the appeal.

which effectively reversed [Coinbase]({{< relref "arbitration_legal#coinbase-v-bielski" >}}) for California cases.
