# Introduction

There is a circuit split if “Manifest Disregard of Law” is a basis to vacate arbitration decisions. It is typical to assert that `9 U.S.C. §10(a)(4)` (arbitrators exceeding their powers) is the basis\.

# Basis

It is typical to assert that `9 U.S.C. §10(a)(4)` (arbitrators exceeding their powers) is the basis to vacate an arbitration award. To succeed under “Manifest Disregard of Law”, there must be “some showing in the record, other than the result obtained, that the arbitrator knew the law and expressly disregarded it.” [^ramos1]
